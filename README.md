# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project is to refactor the code of a website to make it more accessible and user-friendly. This is done by using semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure, adding alt attributes to images and icons, having heading attributes fall in sequential order, and by having a descriptive title.
